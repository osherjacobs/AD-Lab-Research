# Active Directory Security Research

Documentation of ADCS exploitation, Kerberos attack chains, and Windows evasion techniques validated in lab environments.

This repository documents controlled offensive security research conducted in enterprise-modeled lab environments.
Emphasis is placed on attack path realism, defensive visibility, and control failure analysis rather than tool usage.

**Focus areas:**
- Certificate Services abuse (ESC1-16)
- Kerberos delegation attacks
- Windows 11 Enterprise defense bypass
- Other offensive / defensive security topics

**Goal:** Demonstrate where default enterprise configurations fail and what defenders must monitor beyond checkbox security.

All credentials and network details sanitized for public documentation.
