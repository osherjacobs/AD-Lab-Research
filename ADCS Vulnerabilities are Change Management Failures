Active Directory Certificate Services ships secure by default from Microsoft.
Yes, really.
The ESC1–ESC16 vulnerabilities that keep showing up in pentest reports and red-team playbooks?
They’re not Microsoft bugs.
They’re change-management failures.
Think of it this way:
ADCS is the house Microsoft built with strong locks and thick walls.
The ESC series are the vampires waiting outside.
They don’t break in.
Someone inside opens the window for them — usually with a well-meaning but poorly reviewed template change, unchecked enrollment rights, or a “just make it work” override.
I love diving into Certipy, PowerShell one-liners, and hunting misconfigs as much as the next person (probably more).
But the uncomfortable truth is:
The real root cause almost never lives in the terminal.
It lives in the change process, the approval gates, the documentation that nobody reads, and the “we’ll fix it in prod” mentality.
Secure by design means very little if your change management is “design by chaos”.
Let’s stop pretending the tool is broken when the process is what’s bleeding.
What’s your organization’s strongest (or weakest) control around ADCS template changes right now?
