**Active Directory Certificate Services ships secure by default from Microsoft.**  
Yes, really.

The ESC1–ESC16 vulnerabilities that keep popping up in pentest reports and red-team write-ups?  
They’re **not** Microsoft bugs.  
They’re **change-management failures**.

Picture this:  

ADCS is the fortress Microsoft hands you — strong locks, thick walls, solid design.  
The ESC series? They’re the vampires circling outside.  

They don’t smash windows.  
Someone inside **opens the window** for them — usually with a rushed template tweak, unchecked enrollment rights, or a classic “just make it work” override.

I love getting hands-on with Certipy, PowerShell one-liners, and hunting misconfigs as much as anyone (probably more).  
But the hard truth is:

The real failure almost never lives in the terminal.  
It lives in the change process, the approval gates, the documentation no one reads, and the “we’ll fix it in prod” culture.

Secure by design means almost nothing if your change management is “design by chaos”.

Let’s stop pretending the tool is broken when the process is what’s bleeding.

What’s the strongest (or weakest) control your organization has around ADCS template changes right now?
